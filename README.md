# Overview

My goal for this project was to use Java to develop a basic but useful "Guess the Number" game. The 
game covers a number of core Java programming concepts, such as variables, functions, loops, 
conditionals, and the use of the Java Collection Framework (more especially, ArrayList). My 
objectives was to improve my knowledge of Java syntax and bolster my object-oriented programming 
abilities.


I created this software in order to show my abilities to create a whole application with user 
interaction, game logic, and data management, in addition to simply practicing Java. Through the 
project, I was able to learn how to manage game state, handle user input, structure a Java program, 
and persist data using file I/O.




# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code with Java Extension Pack.
OpenJDK 

The Java programming language, combined with its large standard library and support for 
object-oriented projects, provided a robust foundation for developing the game. The use of 
ArrayList from the Java Framework efficient management and display of high scores within the game.

# Future Work

There are several areas I would like to improve and expand upon in this project

- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing for a more interactive user 
experience.
- Enhance error handling and validation for user inputs
- Optimize and refactor code to improve readability and maintainability.
